# gcc-triggermodbrackets
3D Models for printing trigger brackets to be used with mouseclick and mech switch triggers on a gamecube controller

There are files for the Trigger guards modified from a gcc scan, as well as a version of the mouseclick bracket designed for use with springs, it may not actually be better, I just decided to try and make a version that accounted for springs just in case the base bracket did not function well enough with springs for people trying to do analog and digital inputs with mouseclick triggers.

Now also includes files for low profile and full size mech switch brackets
