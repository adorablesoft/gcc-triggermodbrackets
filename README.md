# gcc-mouseclickbracket
3D Models for printing trigger brackets to be used with mouseclick triggers on a gamecube controller

There are files for the Trigger guards modified from a gcc scan, as well as a version of the bracket designed for use with springs, it may not actually be better, I just decided to try and make a version that accounted for springs just in case the base bracket did not function well enough with springs for people trying to do analog and digital inputs with mouseclick triggers.
