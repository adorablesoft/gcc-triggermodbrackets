# Low Profile Mech Switch

This is a brand new version of the file built from the ground up with measurements of switches and scans of original gamecube hardware as guides

The base file is designed for the majority of available varieties of low profile switches, largely the kailh branding

Of the Kailh Switches I recommend Kailh Robins (57gf clicky), as well as Pale Blue (70gf clicky) and Navy (70gf clicky with thicker click bar) with Robins being the standout in my opinion

The KailhV2 Switch version is designed for the newest line of kailh switches which feature very broad stems, which are commonly used for mech triggers

Plugs contains two versions of trigger plugs for use with these brackets, depending on if your switch uses a cross stem like in kailh v2 switches or if you are using some varieties of switches with two pronged wide stems
