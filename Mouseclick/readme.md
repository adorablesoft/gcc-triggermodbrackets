# Mouseclick Brackets

There is an option for the bracket with an indentation for a spring to rest in as well as one without

If you intend to use mouseclick with travel for lightshield I recommend using a shorter plug than normal and attaching some rubber to the underside of the plug to reduce the feedback of making contact with the entire mouse switch

The guards folder includes two sets of files, the original full guards as well as a very stripped down model intended mostly for just holding the bracket in place but it is much easier to print, it's also less sturdy but in my tests has held up reasonably well
