3D Printed Cutting Guide In this repository
Wii Classic Button Pad
Scissors/Flush Cutters can be helpful

1. Take the button pad and trim the outer rim flat and even with the rest of the pad so you can easily place the punch wherever needed
2. Take your guide and place it on the pad with the indentation facing down to align on the rubber dome
3. Put the steel punch over the guide on the pad, using light and the hole to look in and verify the guide is centered if you're unsure
4. Apply force to the steel punch to cut through the pad, depending on how hard you are able to press you may need to tear the pad out if you do not manage to fully cut through. This is best done on a very solid surface to avoid damaging materials below the rubber pad such as the table
5. Place in trigger housing as you would with a normal trigger pad.

Additional notes:

There is a very small difference in height of the different domes on the wcc button pad and all are shorter than the OEM GCC Trigger Pads, so be aware that these will not function without trigger plugs as the center of the trigger will not reach the dome.

For simple way of looking at maintaining analog range:
Short Plugs are ~= to No Plug with OEM Pads
Tall Plugs are ~= to Short Plugs on OEM Pads
120% Scale Tall Plugs ~= to Tall Plugs on OEM Pads

Fires tall plugs at 0.9 Z Scale for short and 1.3 Z Scale for tall
Hollow ended plugs carvac made are best at .85 Z scale for short and 1.2 Z scale for tall
