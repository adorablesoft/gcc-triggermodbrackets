# Full Size Mech Switch

This is a brand new version of the file built from the ground up with measurements of switches and scans of original gamecube hardware as guides

It is designed to be compatible with any full size mechanical switch like used in most keyboards

Full Size Switch triggers are what I would call a destructive mod, they are too tall to fit in the space of the controller by default and require trimming down the center post of the trigger so that you can fit it inside for the full length press and guaranteed actuation as well as trimming the black rumble bracket arm where it holds the trigger paddle, I generally recommend low profile switches as they do not require the modification to the trigger part itself.

Plugs contains new versions of the stem designs, including a stem designed to be compatible with both mx and box style switches and then a box only variety for the best fit with those switch stems
