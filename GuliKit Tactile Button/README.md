# GuliKit Tactile Buttons

These models are to be used with GuliKit Tactile Buttons, which are designed to replicate the general feeling of rubber domes with the goal of being longer lasting

These were made as mostly an experiment but ultimately I found them pretty satisfying as a replacement for a traditional rubber dome digital trigger, they cannot be used for analog as that would require a much more complicated design and likely a two part model that comes together around it

They can be purchased on their own via aliexpress if you're interested in trying them, this model was designed off the 2nd generation design so I cannot guarantee it will work with the 1st generation, these are easily distinguished by the 2nd Gen having an orange stem and the 1st gen having a grey one
